# Lunch-n-Learn

A collection of Proof-Of-Concepts, technical presentations, and code segments that I have collected over the years.  I am finally organizing these items into a collection of Lunch-N-Learn presentations.   The goal is that topic to consist of PowerPoint presentations, associated notes and any associated source code used for demos.

## Topics

- [Docker Fundamentals](Docker%20Fundamentals#readme) - Introduction into Docker, Docker Desktop, and the development workflow around building and deploying applicaitons using Docker
